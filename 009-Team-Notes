Hi, guys -- just to let you know I am now here as a collaborator.  note: when writing

AA: I found the word map very interesting, especially the qualifiers that they allow, 
such as sobriety and literacy. I did notice however that at least on my browser, 
the word maps got cut off and I couldn't see the whole thing. I think it would be 
interesting to tag these words with certain emotions perhaps and look at a bar plot 
of these groupings of words to get a better sense of the notes on inmates.

AA: I would have liked to see types of crimes by location, I would be interested in 
seeing if there were a pattern of types of crimes and ending up at ESP.
