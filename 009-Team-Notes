AA: I found the word map very interesting, especially the qualifiers that they allow, such as sobriety and literacy. I did notice however that at least on my browser, the word maps got cut off and I couldn't see the whole thing. I think it would be interesting to tag these words with certain emotions perhaps and look at a bar plot of these groupings of words to get a better sense of the notes on inmates.
AA: I would have liked to see types of crimes by location, I would be interested in seeing if there were a pattern of types of crimes and ending up at ESP.
