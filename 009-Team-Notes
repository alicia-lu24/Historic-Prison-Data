Hi, guys -- just to let you know I am now here as a collaborator.  note: when writing

AA: I found the word map very interesting, especially the qualifiers that they allow,
such as sobriety and literacy. I did notice however that at least on my browser,
the word maps got cut off and I couldn't see the whole thing. I think it would be
interesting to tag these words with certain emotions perhaps and look at a bar plot
of these groupings of words to get a better sense of the notes on inmates.

AA: I would have liked to see types of crimes by location, I would be interested in
seeing if there were a pattern of types of crimes and ending up at ESP.

JS: I echo Amy's observation about the word maps being cut off.
I tested the site on some of the most common browsers and it seems to
be an issue on all of them.

JS: Something I noticed frequently on the word frequency visualizations was the 
sheer dominance of the word "religious." Despite this, there is no way to
compare data using prisoners' religious preferences as a variable. I am not sure
about all moral instructors' entries, but the religions of prisoners are noted
in the admissions books. I would be curious if there are any correlations or
trends between certain religious denominations and other variables. Were there
more prisoners of a certain denomination than others?

JS: While not necessarily an error in the data, I think the site curators should
have avoided naming the axes on various graphs Corpus A and Corpus B, when the
admissions books used for visualizing the data are also delineated by the letters
A and B, as well as D. Originally, I became confused by the charts thinking that
Admissions Book D was being ignored before I realized my mistake.

JS: Seeing the "objects" of certain crimes might have been interesting. What
were people burglarizing to get such long sentences? For those there on murder
charges, were there trends in the types of victims?
